Solution for Task 16: Ansible Vault

Task 16 focuses on using Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive variables, such as passwords or API keys, and securely using them in playbooks. This task teaches how to manage sensitive data in automation workflows effectively.

Objective

    Encrypt sensitive variables using Ansible Vault.

    Use the encrypted variables in a playbook.

    Execute the playbook to verify functionality.

1. Understanding Ansible Vault

    Purpose: Ansible Vault provides encryption for sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, or confidential configurations.

    Use Case: Protect sensitive variables in vars.yml or other files used in playbooks.

2. Steps to Complete the Task

Step 1: Create and Encrypt a Variables File

    Create a Variables File:

        Save sensitive data in a YAML file (e.g., secure_vars.yml):

            db_password: "MySecurePassword123"
            api_key: "12345-abcde-67890-fghij"

    Encrypt the File with Ansible Vault:

        Use the ansible-vault encrypt command to encrypt the file:

            ansible-vault encrypt secure_vars.yml

        Enter and confirm a password when prompted. This password will be required to decrypt or use the file.

    Verify the Encryption:

        Open the file to confirm it is encrypted:

            cat secure_vars.yml

        The content should appear as unreadable, encrypted data.

Step 2: Use the Encrypted Variables in a Playbook

    Write a Playbook:

        Create a playbook (e.g., use_vault.yml) that references the encrypted variables:

            ---
            - name: Use Encrypted Variables
              hosts: all
              vars_files:
                - secure_vars.yml
              tasks:
                - name: Display the database password
                  debug:
                    msg: "The database password is {{ db_password }}"
             
                - name: Display the API key
                  debug:
                    msg: "The API key is {{ api_key }}"

    Explanation:

        The vars_files directive includes the encrypted file secure_vars.yml.

        The debug module is used to display the sensitive variables to confirm they are accessible.

Step 3: Execute the Playbook

    Run the Playbook with Ansible Vault:

        Use the --ask-vault-pass flag to provide the password at runtime:

            ansible-playbook use_vault.yml --ask-vault-pass

        Enter the vault password when prompted.

    Verify Output:

        The debug tasks should display the decrypted values of db_password and api_key.

Step 4: Updating and Re-encrypting Variables

    Edit the Encrypted File:

        Use the ansible-vault edit command to modify the encrypted file:

            ansible-vault edit secure_vars.yml

        Enter the vault password to decrypt and edit the file.

    Re-encrypt Automatically:

        After editing, the file is automatically re-encrypted.

3. Key Concepts for Novice Learners

    Commands Overview:

        ansible-vault encrypt <file>: Encrypts a file.

        ansible-vault decrypt <file>: Decrypts a file.

        ansible-vault edit <file>: Edits an encrypted file.

        ansible-vault rekey <file>: Changes the vault password.

    Vault Password:

        The same password must be used to encrypt and decrypt the file.

        Store the password securely (e.g., in a password manager).

    Usage in Playbooks:

        Encrypted files can be included like any other vars_files.

        Ansible automatically decrypts the file at runtime using the provided password.

4. Troubleshooting Tips

    "Decryption Failed" Error:

        Ensure the correct password is provided.

        Verify the file was encrypted successfully.

    Cannot Access Variables:

        Check that the vars_files directive includes the correct path to the encrypted file.

    Forgotten Vault Password:

        If the vault password is lost, the file cannot be decrypted.

5. Complete Playbook

Below is the complete playbook to use encrypted variables:

    ---
    - name: Use Encrypted Variables
      hosts: all
      vars_files:
        - secure_vars.yml
      tasks:
        - name: Display the database password
          debug:
            msg: "The database password is {{ db_password }}"
     
        - name: Display the API key
          debug:
            msg: "The API key is {{ api_key }}"
