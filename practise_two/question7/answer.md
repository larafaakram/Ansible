Solution for Task 7: Archive System Logs

Task 7 involves creating a playbook to archive the /var/log directory into a compressed file named system-logs.zip and storing it in the /backups directory on all managed nodes. The archive should have specific ownership settings.

Objective

    Archive the /var/log directory into a file named system-logs.zip located at /backups/system-logs.zip.

    Set ownership of the archive to ansibleadmin.

    Verify the archive creation and permissions.

1. Steps to Complete the Task

Step 1: Write the Playbook

    Create the Playbook File:

        Open a text editor to create the playbook:

            vi /home/ansibleadmin/ansible/archive_logs.yml

    Add the Following Content:

        ---
        - name: Archive System Logs
          hosts: all
          become: yes
          tasks:
            - name: Ensure /backups directory exists
              file:
                path: /backups
                state: directory
                owner: ansibleadmin
                group: ansibleadmin
                mode: '0755'
         
            - name: Archive /var/log into /backups/system-logs.zip
              archive:
                path: /var/log
                dest: /backups/system-logs.zip
                format: zip
         
            - name: Set ownership of the archive
              file:
                path: /backups/system-logs.zip
                owner: ansibleadmin
                group: ansibleadmin

Explanation of the Playbook:

    Ensure Directory Exists:

        The file module ensures the /backups directory is present with the correct ownership and permissions.

    Archive Logs:

        The archive module compresses the /var/log directory into a .zip file and saves it in /backups.

    Set Ownership:

        The file module adjusts the ownership of the archive file to ansibleadmin.

Step 2: Execute the Playbook

    Run the Playbook:

        ansible-playbook /home/ansibleadmin/ansible/archive_logs.yml

    Expected Output:

        The playbook should complete successfully, creating the archive and setting the correct ownership.

Step 3: Verify the Results

    Check the Archive File:

        Verify the presence and ownership of the archive file:

            ansible all -m shell -a "ls -l /backups/system-logs.zip"

        Expected Output:

            -rw-r--r-- 1 ansibleadmin ansibleadmin <size> /backups/system-logs.zip

    Test the Archive:

        Verify the contents of the archive:

            ansible all -m shell -a "unzip -l /backups/system-logs.zip"

        Ensure the output lists files from /var/log.

2. Key Concepts for Novice Learners

    Directory Management:

        Use the file module to create directories and set permissions.

    Archiving:

        The archive module simplifies compressing files or directories into various formats (e.g., .zip, .tar).

    Ownership:

        Set the correct ownership and permissions for security and usability.

3. Troubleshooting Tips

    Archive Not Created:

        Verify that the /var/log directory exists on the managed nodes:

            ansible all -m shell -a "ls /var/log"

    Ownership Not Applied:

        Check for errors in the playbook's file module task.

    Directory Missing:

        Ensure the /backups directory is created before archiving.
