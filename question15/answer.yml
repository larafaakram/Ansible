Solution for Task 15: Ansible Tower Basics

Task 15 involves working with Ansible Tower, a web-based interface for managing Ansible tasks. This task teaches you how to create a project and inventory in Ansible Tower, configure a job template, and execute it successfully.

Objective

    Create a project in Ansible Tower.

    Define an inventory for the managed nodes.

    Configure and execute a job template to perform a specific task.

1. Understanding Ansible Tower Basics

    Project: A collection of playbooks stored in a source control system (e.g., Git).

    Inventory: A collection of hosts (managed nodes) grouped logically for targeting in tasks.

    Job Template: A predefined configuration to run a playbook on a specified inventory.

2. Steps to Complete the Task

Step 1: Set Up Ansible Tower

    Access Ansible Tower:

        Open a web browser and navigate to the Ansible Tower URL.

        Log in with your credentials.

    Navigate to the Dashboard:

        Use the left-hand menu to access key sections like Projects, Inventories, and Job Templates.

Step 2: Create a Project

    Steps to Create a Project:

        Navigate to the Projects tab.

        Click the Add (+) button to create a new project.

    Project Configuration:

        Name: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "RHCE Practice Project").

        Organization: Select the default organization or create a new one.

        Source Control Type: Choose the repository type (e.g., Git, SVN).

        Source Control URL: Provide the repository URL where your playbooks are stored.

        Branch: Specify the branch (e.g., main).

        Save the project.

    Verify the Project:

        Sync the project to fetch playbooks from the repository.

Step 3: Create an Inventory

    Steps to Create an Inventory:

        Navigate to the Inventories tab.

        Click the Add (+) button to create a new inventory.

    Inventory Configuration:

        Name: Provide a name for the inventory (e.g., "RHCE Practice Inventory").

        Organization: Assign the inventory to the same organization as the project.

        Save the inventory.

    Add Hosts to the Inventory:

        Select the inventory and click Hosts.

        Add managed nodes by specifying their hostnames or IP addresses.

    Group Hosts (Optional):

        Create logical groups for the hosts (e.g., "webservers", "databases").

Step 4: Create a Job Template

    Steps to Create a Job Template:

        Navigate to the Templates tab.

        Click the Add (+) button and select Job Template.

    Job Template Configuration:

        Name: Provide a name for the job template (e.g., "Deploy Web Server").

        Job Type: Choose Run.

        Inventory: Select the inventory created earlier.

        Project: Select the project linked to the repository.

        Playbook: Choose the specific playbook from the project (e.g., webserver.yml).

        Credentials: Add credentials for connecting to the managed nodes (e.g., SSH keys).

        Save the template.

Step 5: Execute the Job Template

    Run the Job:

        Navigate to the Templates tab.

        Click the Launch button next to the job template.

    Monitor Job Execution:

        View real-time output logs in the Job Details view.

        Verify successful execution of tasks.

    Verify Results:

        Check the managed nodes to ensure the playbook tasks were executed successfully.

3. Key Concepts for Novice Learners

    Ansible Tower Components:

        Project: Links to a source control repository containing playbooks.

        Inventory: Lists the managed nodes targeted by playbooks.

        Job Template: Combines the project, inventory, and playbook into an executable job.

    Credentials:

        Used to authenticate with managed nodes (e.g., SSH keys).

    Playbook Execution:

        Ansible Tower runs the playbook on the selected inventory nodes using the specified configuration.

4. Troubleshooting Tips

    Repository Sync Issues:

        Ensure the source control URL and credentials are correct.

    Inventory Errors:

        Verify hostnames or IP addresses in the inventory.

    Job Execution Fails:

        Check the Job Details view for error logs.

        Test SSH connectivity from the control node to managed nodes.
